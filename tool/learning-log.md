## Tool: **Earsketch**

## Project: **Music Game with Javascript**

---

### 10/4/24:
* Experimented with the website on [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/)
  * found out it uses both python and javascript
* found a beginner [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtaGTRA48ms)
  * this uses python but it is really similar
* need to know how to connect it with other things like jsbin and not just on the website

### 10/13/24:
* tested on [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/?sharing=MiQYCfFVzS1eXFgGYppkFg) more
  * experimented with effects more
* watched this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pkS95U8zRg)
* found out there is a block mode for earsketch, can make things easier

### 10/20/24:
* decided to create Earsketch account on the website to see what happens
* found the [Earsketch Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqtFcjm-0WMCxl0y-m87EuQ)
  * have 7 tutorial videos on their channel, not many views though
* found out they have a [Cirriculum Section](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/?curriculum=/en/v2/unit-1&language=javascript) in the editor so you can learn while doing the code
  * need to learn more about effects and other types of things on Earsketch, not just adding sounds
* How can I be able to use EarSketch outside of it's website?

### 10/26/2024:
* learned how to share code with [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/?sharing=MiQYCfFVzS1eXFgGYppkFg)
  * I learned how to input sounds into the music editor and what a tempo is
  * Also learned how to do effects, such as gaining audio for example
  * learned to input `var` and making beats
  * Am I able to use functions and even more javascript elements in Earsketch, or only a few are applicable here?
 
### 11/4/2024:
* ended up connecting my current Earsketch code to [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/woxajunela/1/edit?html,output)
  * the code shows up on the output of jsbin, which is interesting
  * can't edit the code on jsbin, but it's connected to Earsketch
  * if you edit on Earsketch then reload the jsbin page, then it shows up
* if you hide both the DAW (digital audio workstation) and the code, then it only shows the play button, but it still works
* I want to see if I am able to hide the whole code, but it is still able to produce sounds

### 11/9/24:
* started a new [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/?sharing=mMnc0kl_hpBlouIoSmUzQA) code to match with what the cirriculum says, plus to test out new sounds available in the program
  * learned that conditionals can work well with Earsketch as you can manipulate which tracks you want to be louder or less louder than others easier than manually do it
  * also used variables a lot, which makes writing names for sounds more easy, especially if you have to use them constantly and/or if those names are quite long, which are a lot
    * though the names automatically fill for you in Earsketch, it is convenient to use variable names to make things easier for you, which is how javascript works
* added new code in [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/yayubolaze/edit?html,css,output)
  * added css and divs to make it look more pretty, but can't change the code itself, only what's around it
  * both of them can be played at the same time and the sounds overlap with each other
  * How can I make it not show while still playing the sound? Can it connect to other regular javascript code too?
