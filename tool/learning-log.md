### 10/4/24:
* Experimented with the website on [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/)
  * found out it uses both python and javascript
* found a beginner [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtaGTRA48ms)
  * this uses python but it is really similar
* need to know how to connect it with other things like jsbin and not just on the website
