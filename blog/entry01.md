## Choosing the Tool and the Game
Since this is the start of a new year, we have a new Freedom Project to do. So of course, we had to do some tinkering and exploration before we chose our final tool to do for our big Freedom Project. The tool I chose is Earsketch, which is a music making code editor, and I decided to work in a group to make a music game together, so I hope that will work out well.

### Coming up with ideas for a game
Of course, with the Freedom Project this year, we have to come up with something to base it on. This year is the SEP11 course, so we are learning Javascript, a new coding language that is connected with html and css in someways, and we have to make an app/game with it, by yourself or in a group. Due to how making games require more work, especially with a new coding language, many people got into groups this year than last year, including myself. I ended up being in a group with two other friends of mine, Nancy and Michelle. We then needed to come up with a game together, and since we all liked music, we decided to make a *music game* together. It'll probably be **more** complicated than a typical music game because we all have different tools, but I think it'll work out well. I believe in it.

### Tinkering with Earsketch
Of course, in order to learn our tool, we have to actually practice and familiarize ourselves with the tool we chose to learn. I ended up tinkering a lot with Earsketch and recording it on my [learning log](/tool/learning-log.md). I ended up having to edit on the official code editor for [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/). This link doesn't lead to my code in particular, but it does automatically save your progress for you, and you can share it with a specific link given, mine's can be found in my learning log. I also managed to connect it with [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/yayubolaze/edit?html,css,output), to see how Earsketch looks in other websites.

I ended up learning a lot about Earsketch and even *music* so far by tinkering and coding with it. For example, since the way Earsketch is formatted is similar to how a regular music editor works, I ended up learning about things such as beats, tempos, tracks, effects, and much more. I also ended up incorporating javascript because that's what we're supposed to do, like `var` for example. I ended up making a lot of projects on my code editor, like a [random](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/?sharing=mMnc0kl_hpBlouIoSmUzQA) one, one that incorporates [house music](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/?sharing=6RUq-vYFHsDSki1kbHMugw), and much more! *Obviously*, I have to do a lot more in order to incorporate more javascript, but Earsketch surprisingly works well with it's **own** exclusive elements completely. But I will definetly have to incorporate some more javascript in the future the more we learn, I'll make sure of it. Overall, it's been going good learning my tool.

## EDP
Currently I'm at the first two steps of the Engineering Design Process, which are step 1, define the problem, and 2, research the problem. Basically the problem here is to make a game, or any type of app, using the skills we use in javascript and the tools we are using. The research is just learning our tool, and javascript of course.

## Skills
While I learned a lot of things while getting to know my tool better, I ended up learning a couple of skills along the way of my learning process. Here's a few of them. 

### Keeping track of what you learned
One skill I learned while tinkering with my tool is keeping track of what I learned. Of course I **have** to do this for a grade, but recording on my [learning log](/tool/learning-log.md) really helped me process the information I learned at Earsketch better. At first, I was a bit **confused** as Earsketch was completely different from what I expected from the typical tools I tested out before. However, after testing it out and writing down things I did and need to work on, the workflow felt easier to keep up with. Due to keeping track, I can now look back and see what else there needs to be done.

### Determination
Another skill I learned was to have determination. While Earsketch isn't really a popular tool amongst people, I still decided to use it because I think it'll be useful for the type of game I plan to do with my friends, and I believed that Earsketch was a good tool for me to use as it's both easy to use and makes me think about what I'm supposed to do better. Turns out, I was right, and now I'm glad that my tool is Earsketch. There's still needs to be more to be done with Earsketch, but so far, I'm all set!

## What's Next?
Now, I just have to keep moving forward with learning not only my tool, but **also** javascript, as there's still a lot more to go!
