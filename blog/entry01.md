## Choosing the Tool and the Game
Since this is the start of a new year, we have a new Freedom Project to do. So of course, we had to do some tinkering and exploration before we chose our final tool to do for our big Freedom Project. The tool I chose is Earsketch, which is a music making code editor, and I decided to work in a group to make a music game together, so I hope that will work out well.

### Tinkering with Earsketch


I ended up tinkering a lot and recording it on my [learning log](/tool/learning-log.md).
